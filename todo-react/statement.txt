KATA #1 — Tasks Module (React + Clean Architecture)

Description:
Create a small Tasks module following clean architecture principles. You must implement:
- A mock API endpoint returning a list of tasks in the format: [{ id, title, done }].
- A service layer responsible for fetching and updating tasks.
- A useCase (application) layer exposing two functions: getTasks() and toggleTask(id).
- A React component that renders the list of tasks and toggles each task’s "done" state when clicked.

Rules:
- No business logic inside React components.
- No direct fetch calls inside components. Everything must go through the useCase layer.
- UI is simple: a vertical list of tasks.
- State management can be done using either useState or useReducer.
- Do not use external libraries beyond React.

Goal:
Reinforce clean architecture structuring in React and train clarity, calm thinking, and layering discipline.
